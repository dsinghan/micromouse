Micromouse Project

Description:
        The UCLA IEEE Micromouse project was to build a small autonomous maze-solving robot to traverse a maze and find its way to a goal. My team of 3 had to print our own PCB, solder the micromouse all together, program it through the maze, and ultimately compete with other teams.
        While we were able to finish designing and printing our PCB, we were unable to continue our project due to COVID-19. Instead of coding for our robot, we concluded our project by writing code to allow a mouse to traverse a maze virtually.

Included files:
        main.cpp - c++ source file allowing a mouse(^) to avoid walls (|) and reach a goal by performing a depth-first search algorithm
